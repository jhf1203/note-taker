### Description
      
This is a simple application that allows the user to write, save, delete, and review notes. This allows the user to better organize their thoughts and keep track of tasks that they wish to complete.  The easy UI and user functionality in this app allows notes to be taken and saved quickly.

### Instructions
  
This is browser-based for the user, so no installation is required.  The deployed app can be found [here](https://shrouded-spire-80320.herokuapp.com/).  

For the back-end functionality, only Express will need to be installed manually.  However, there are a few built-in packages that are required as well:
- path | for easier access to HTML routes.
- fs | to read get requests of the note data, and submit/write post requests.
- util | to aid in some asynchronous commands within the API routes.

### Usage
  
Use of the note taker application has simplicity and functionality in mind.  To begin simply access the landing page [here](https://shrouded-spire-80320.herokuapp.com/) and click on the "Get Started" button, or visit the notes page [directly](https://shrouded-spire-80320.herokuapp.com/notes).  Once on the notes page:
- Enter the note title and the note text into the provided input areas (as denoted by placeholder text).
- Once you begin typing, a floppy disc icon will appear in the top right-hand corner next to the pencil icon.  Click on it to save your note once completed.
- Your note will then populate into the column on your left, displaying the note title in ascending order from when the note was created.  
- To view your note of choice, click on the area in which it occupies in the sidebar, and its title and text will then populate the placeholder text in the entry screen.
- To delete a note, simply click on the red trash can icon in the note sidebar.
